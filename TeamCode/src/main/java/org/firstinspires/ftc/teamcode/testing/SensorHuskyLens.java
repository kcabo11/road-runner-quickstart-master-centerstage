 * This OpMode illustrates how to use the DFRobot HuskyLens.
 *
 * The HuskyLens is a Vision Sensor with a built-in object detection model.  It can
 * detect a number of predefined objects and AprilTags in the 36h11 family, can
 * recognize colors, and can be trained to detect custom objects. See this website for
 * documentation: https://wiki.dfrobot.com/HUSKYLENS_V1.0_SKU_SEN0305_SEN0336
 *
 * This sample illustrates how to detect AprilTags, but can be used to detect other types
 * of objects by changing the algorithm. It assumes that the HuskyLens is configured with
 * a name of "huskylens".
 *
 * Use Android Studio to Copy this Class, and Paste it into your team's code folder with a new name.
 * Remove or comment out the @Disabled line to add this OpMode to the Driver Station OpMode list

    /*          *** PSEUDOCODE FOR DATA RETRIEVED FROM HUSKYLENS ***

                Assuming we get an x coordinate from the AprilTag we scan,
                how do we center the AprilTag in the vision field of the HuskyLens sensor (effectively turning the robot)?

                1. If x coordinate > origin (160,120), turn right until x coordinate equals origin;
                   If x coordinate < origin (160,120), turn left until x coordinate equals origin

                   *THIS IS DEPENDENT UPON WHAT POSITION IS NEEDED FOR PIXEL PLACEMENT*  - also the Huskylens reads distance
                2. If y coordinate > origin (160,120), move forward until y coordinate equals origin;
                   If y coordinate < origin (160,120), move backward until y coordinate equals origin


                From here, we can move towards the backdrop, and place a pixel(s)
                1. Move forward until you get to proper location for pixel release
                2. Release pixel(s) onto backdrop

                *** PID PSEUDOCODE ***

                1. set movement motors to (motors)
                2. set (Integral) to 0
                3. set (lastError) to 0
                -- FOREVER LOOP --
                4. set (Error) to [(sensor) - 50]
                5. set (P-fix) to [Error * 0.3]
                6. set (Integral) to [Integral + Error]
                7. set (I-fix) to [Integral * 0.001]
                8. set (Derivative) to [Error - lastError]
                9. set (lastError) to [Error]
                10. set (D-fix) to [Derivative * 1]
                11. set (correction) to [P-fix + I-fix + D-fix]
                12. start moving at [40 + correction][40 - correction] %power
